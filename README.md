_Fractal Tree Generation_
------
__Description__  
This Work-In-Progress program has the ability to generate random or specific geometric fractal trees in a two dimensional space, with varying sizes, angles, and color schemes.

__Sample Images__  
Images saved using the program's own save feature, that I have found to be good samples of the program's capabilities over the development process can be found here: http://ultraimg.com/album/Es  
  
*Please note that the .gitignore has an entry to ignore all .png files inside the desktop section of the project. This is to prevent any pictures taken during testing/development to be pushed to the repository.*
